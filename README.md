# BrickBreakerOpenGL
A re-creation of the game Brick Breaker made in OpenGl

Simple recreation using OpenGL graphics, coded entirely in c++ 

The game currently plays by left clicking on the red square and dragging the cursor towards where you want it to go then releasing. <br /> 
The further the cursor is dragged before release the quicked the ball will move so its possible to propel it to absurd speeds. <br /> 
Paddle is moved by using the 'a' key to move it left and the 'd' key to move it right. <br /> 
Paddle movements won't work for 'A' and 'D' currently. <br />
